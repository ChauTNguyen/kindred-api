# Task List

- [ ] Add an option to space out requests. Maybe I should make this the default though (should still provide flexibility to users).
- [ ] Add tests (that handle parameters, errors, then the API itself). Make sure I add callback printing tests too!
- [ ] Fix 404 Promise issues
- [ ] Make promises retry more flexible (users can pass in time before retry, how many times they want it to keep going)
- [ ] Add the rest of the list, by.id, by.name, by.account functions
- [ ] Make error classes
- [ ] Make more constants such as Resending promise req, Resending callback req, errors, etc
