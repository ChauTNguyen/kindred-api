# Task List
~ = in progress
- [ ] Comment my code extensively.. ~
- [ ] Add extensive tests that cover important functionality such as querystrings ~
- [x] Add an [option to space out requests](https://github.com/ChauTNguyen/kindred-api/wiki/Rate-Limiter). ~~Maybe I should make this the default though (should still provide flexibility to users)~~.
- [x] Add tests (that handle parameters, errors, then the API itself). Make sure I add callback printing tests too! (90% coverage!!! obviously isn't indicative of a good suite, but this is a good starting point)
- [ ] Add the rest of the list, by.id, by.name, by.account functions ~
- [ ] Refactor code to make lib more performant ~
- [x] [Fix 404 Promise issues](https://github.com/ChauTNguyen/kindred-api/commit/3fd4ac7ac04aa3a992098b22e987807f170efcc6)
- [ ] Make promises retry more flexible (users can pass in time before retry, how many times they want it to keep going)
- [ ] Make error classes
- [ ] Make more constants such as Resending promise req, Resending callback req, errors, etc
